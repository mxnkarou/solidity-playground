Solidity Notes

Best practices:

- make Functions private by default & set public when needed.
- private functions are conventionally prefixed with an underscore.
  - e.g. function "_addToArray(uint int) private {}".
- use "memory" if a variable is not needed after computations. (e.g. Pure Functions, View Functions)
